Flow-based programming for the Internet of Things.

![Node-RED in the Home Assistant Frontend](images/screenshot.png)

## About

Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices,
APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.

It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows
using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its
runtime in a single click.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. [Add our Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install the "Node-RED" add-on.
1. Set a `credential_secret`, which is used to encrypt sensitive data.
   This is just a "password", which you should save on a secondary location.
1. If you do NOT use SSL, be sure to set the `ssl` option to `false`.
1. Start the "Node-RED" add-on.
1. Check the logs of "Node-RED" to see if everything went well.
1. Log in with your Home Assistant username/password.
1. The add-on works straight out the box! No need to configure a server!

**Note**: The add-on is **pre-configured** out of the box! There is no need
to add/change/update the server connection settings!

Please read the rest of this document further instructions.

**NOTE**: Do not add this repository to Hass.io, please use:
`https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository`.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed.

Example add-on configuration:

```json
{
  "log_level": "info",
  "credential_secret": "KJHhfdhiFRENCKfsdfdsDHFHDJS",
  "http_node": {
    "username": "MarryPoppins",
    "password": "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"
  },
  "http_static": {
    "username": "MarryPoppins",
    "password": "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"
  },
  "port": 1880,
  "ssl": true,
  "certfile": "fullchain.pem",
  "keyfile": "privkey.pem",
  "require_ssl": true,
  "system_packages": [
    "ffmpeg"
  ],
  "npm_packages": [
    "node-red-admin"
  ],
  "init_commands": [
    "echo 'This is a test'",
    "echo 'So is this...'"
  ]
}
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `port`

The default port for Node-RED is `1880`, but sometimes you'd just like to
have it on another port, right? Remember, if you change to port,
be sure it is not in use by something else already!

### Option: `ssl`

Enables/Disables SSL (HTTPS) on the web interface.
Set it `true` to enable it, `false` otherwise.

### Option: `certfile`

The certificate file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default for Hass.io_

### Option: `keyfile`

The private key file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default for Hass.io_

### Option: `require_ssl`

This options can be used to cause insecure HTTP connections to be redirected
to HTTPS. This is recommended when you have SSL enabled.

### Option: `credential_secret`

Credentials are encrypted by Node-RED in storage, using secret key.
This option allows you to specify your secret key. This can be anything
you like, it is just like a password. Be sure to store it somewhere safe.
You might need it in the future! (e.g., When restoring a backup).

**Note**: _Once you set this property, do not change it - doing so will prevent
Node-RED from being able to decrypt your existing credentials and they will be
lost._

**Note**: _This option support secrets, e.g., `!secret red_secret`._

### Option: `http_node`

To password protect the node-defined HTTP endpoints (httpNodeRoot),
the following properties can be used:

- `username`
- `password`

**Note**: _These options support secrets, e.g., `!secret red_password`._

### Option: `http_static`

To password protect the static content (httpStatic), the following
properties can be used:

- `username`
- `password`

**Note**: _These options support secrets, e.g., `!secret red_password`._

### Option: `system_packages`

Allows you to specify additional [Alpine packages][alpine-packages] to be
installed to your Node-RED setup (e.g., `g++`. `make`, `ffmpeg`).

**Note**: _Adding many packages will result in a longer start-up time
for the add-on._

### Option: `npm_packages`

Allows you to specify additional [NPM packages][npm-packages] or
[Node-RED nodes][node-red-nodes] to be installed to your Node-RED setup
(e.g., `node-red-dashboard`, `node-red-contrib-ccu`).

**Note**: _Adding many packages will result in a longer start-up time
for the add-on._

### Option: `init_commands`

Customize your Node-RED environment even more with the `init_commands` option.
Add one or more shell commands to the list, and they will be executed every
single time this add-on starts.

### Option: `i_like_to_be_pwned`

Adding this option to the add-on configuration allows to you bypass the
HaveIBeenPwned password requirement by setting it to `true`.

**Note**: _We STRONGLY suggest picking a stronger/safer password instead of
using this option! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!_

### Option: `leave_front_door_open`

Adding this option to the add-on configuration allows you to disable
authentication on the add-on by setting it to `true` and leaving the
username and password empty.

**Note**: _We STRONGLY suggest, not to use this, even if this add-on is
only exposed to your internal network. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!_

## Embedding into Home Assistant

It is possible to embed the Node-RED interface directly into
Home Assistant, allowing you to access it through the Home Assistant frontend.

Home Assistant provides the `panel_iframe` component, for these purposes.

Example configuration:

```yaml
panel_iframe:
  nodered:
    title: Node-RED
    icon: mdi:sitemap
    url: http://addres.to.your.hass.io:1880
```

## FAQ

### I'm having all kinds of issues after upgrading to v1.x.x

A lot has changed, since v1.0.0. Maybe you've missed the release/upgrade notes?
Please be sure to read them and to follow the upgrade instructions.

<https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-node-red/releases/tag/v1.0.0>

### I'm unable to log in, after upgrading to v1.x.x

The login uses Home Assistant's authentication system. You can now login using
the same username and password as you use to log on to
the Home Assistant frontend.

### Node-RED could not establish connection

So, this is like the most asked question. It involves messages in the error
logs that look like this:

```text
Home assistant connection failed with error: Connection to home assistant could
not be established with config: http://XXXXX.duckdns.org <password redacted>
```

The solution to this is simple:

- Click on one of the Home Assistant nodes in your flow.
- Click on the little edit button, next to the server name.
- Change the URL to: `http://hassio/homeassistant`.
- Save it, and deploy your flow!
- Now the add-on handles the authentication for you.

### The configured certfile is not found

This error is shown when you have enabled `ssl` in the add-on option,
but the SSL certificate files are not found on disk.

Either correct the `certfile` in case you are using SSL, get an SSL certificate
(which you actually should) OR disable the `ssl` feature by setting the
configuration option to `false`.
